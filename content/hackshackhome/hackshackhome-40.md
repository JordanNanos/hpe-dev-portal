description: "October 16, 2024: Quantum computing is an active area of research
  that has attracted attention from key players in academia and industry. Join
  this talk to get an overview of the collaboration between Classiq and HPE, and
  learn how classical supercomputers are valuable candidates for the execution
  of hybrid workflows while sustaining the classical portion of the computation
  and communication of potentially large data volumes."
