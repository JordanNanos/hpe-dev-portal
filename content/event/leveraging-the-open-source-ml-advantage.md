## Leveraging the open source ML advantage

May 1, 2024

Join this virtual session from HPE Data Science Community for discussions around:

* Scaling ML model training using state-of-the-art hyperparameter tuning and distributed training methods - using all open source software.
* Getting started with open-source LLMs in our playground feature: GenAI studio.
* Smoothly transitioning from foundation model selection and prompt engineering to fine-tuning and deployment.
